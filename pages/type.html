      <h3>Brief:</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this flyer is to catch the viewer's attention and inform them about a free tutoring service. It is important to take typography, color, and layout into account. The text must be interesting but readable and match the theme of the design.</p>
      <h4>Role: Graphic Designer</h4>
      <h4>Date: Jan 2025 - Feb 2025 </h4>
      <h4>Approach:</h4>
      <p>I started by researching flyers that provide services like tutoring. I also looked for inpiration from past DVC flyers. Since there was a lot of information to add, I chose to keep the layout simple and focus on the text.</p>
      <h4>Process:</h4>
      <p>Since this flyer was made for Diablo Valley College, I referenced Olga Serzhantova's DVC Online Education Style Guide.</p>
      <p>All colors used in the poster are part of the approved color variations. I was given the freedom to choose whatever theme I wanted for this project, so I loosely based the design on 90s websites. For this reason, I chose the pixelated font, Born2bSporty FS, for the display text and headings.</p>
