      <h3>Brief:</h3>
      <p>This project utilizes different APIs to create an interesting web experience. At least two APIs must be used together in a way that makes sense to users. The purpose of this project is to understand how fetch, async, and await work in JavaScript.</p>
      <h4>Role:</h4>
      <p>Web Designer</p>
      <h4>Date:</h4>
      <p>Nov 2024 - Dec 2024</p>
      <h4>Approach:</h4>
      <p>My initial idea was to recreate blackjack using a deck of cards API. The secondary API would be card backings that change every time the game reloads.</p>
      <h4>Process:</h4>
      <p>On the left is my original pseudocode for Blackjack. While simple enough to play, there are a lot of components to keep track of when programming it properly. On the right is my pseudocode for High Card, Low Card.</p>
      <p>By focusing on two cards, programming the game became a lot easier. The High Card, Low Card checks which card is higher, rather than the number of cards, whether a player's hand is greater than 21, if and how aces are being used, and much more.</p>

      <p>The design for the website was simple enough. I wanted it to emulate the style of old pc games like solitaire or Hoyle Card Games.</p>
