      <h1>UXUI (User Experience and User Interface)</h1>
      <h2>Name: Kurzgesagt (app and website)</h2>
      <h3>Brief:</h3>
      <p>The goal of this project is to create a conceptual app and supplementary website for an organization or business. This project allows us to become familiar with the design process from brainstorming to building.</p>
      <h4>Role: UXUI Designer</h4>
      <h4>Date: Aug 2023 - Dec 2023</h4>
      <h4>Approach:</h4>
      <p>For this project, I used Agile Methodologies to create an app based on the popular educational YouTube channel, Kurzgesagt. First, I identified the problem: We need more accessible resources for kids to learn. Next, I researched potential competitors that solve similar problems and gather data on the type of person that would use my app. After establishing my audience, I began brainstorming possible features, layouts, and designs for the app. Once I had a general wireframe, I began looking at color schemes, fonts, and iconography to use in my design. I designed, tested, adjusted, and retested until I created a prototype that my audience liked.</p>
      <h4>Process:</h4>
      <p>My biggest inspiration for Kurzgesagt was Duolingo's user interface. Each navigation tab had a purpose, and the main functions of the app were easy to figure out.</p>
