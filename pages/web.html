      <h3>Brief:</h3>
      <p>This project utilizes different APIs to create an interesting web experience. At least two APIs must be used together in a way that makes sense to users. The purpose of this project is to understand how fetch, async, and await work in JavaScript.</p>
      <h4>Role: Web Designer</h4>
      <h4>Date: Nov 2024 - Dec 2024</h4>
      <h4>Approach:</h4>
      <p>My initial idea was to recreate blackjack using a deck of cards API. The secondary API would be card backings that change every time the game reloads.</p>
      <h4>Process:</h4>
      <p>On the left is my original pseudocode for Blackjack. While simple enough to play, there are a lot of components to keep track of when programming it properly. On the right is my pseudocode for High Card, Low Card. By focusing on two cards, programming the game became a lot easier. The game relies on which card is higher, rather than checking for number of cards, whether that number is greater than 21, if and how aces are being used, and much more.</p>

      <p>The design for the website was simple enough. I wanted it to emulate the style of old pc games like solitaire or Hoyle Card Games.</p>
