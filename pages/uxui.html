      <h2>Project Name: Kurzgesagt</h2>
      <h3>About this Project:</h3>
      <p>This project focuses on the design process from beginning to end. Tasks include researching the market for opportunities, conducting interviews to identify a client base, developing a site map and wireframe of your product, testing the prototype with real users, and presenting your findings to an audience. Kurzgesagt is a conceptual app based on the YouTube channel under the same name. The design is based on Duolingo and Khan Academy with a focus on science and technology.</p>
      <h4>Date: Aug 2023 - Dec 2023</h4>
      <h4>Role: UXUI Designer</h4>
      <h4>Approach:</h4>
      <p>For this project, I used the Agile Methodologies to create an app based on the popular educational YouTube channel, Kurzgesagt. First, I identified the problem: We need more accessible resources for kids to learn. Next, I researched potential competitors that solve similar problems and gather data on the type of person that would use my app. After establishing my audience, I began brainstorming possible features, layouts, and designs for the app. Once I had a general wireframe, I began looking at color schemes, fonts, and iconography to use in my design. I designed, tested, adjusted, and retested until I created a prototype that my audience liked.</p>
