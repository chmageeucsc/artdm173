        <h4>Brief:</h4>
        <p>The purpose of this flyer is to catch the viewer's attention and inform them about a free tutoring service. It is important to take typography, color, and layout into account. The text must be interesting but readable and match the theme of the design.</p>

        <h4>Date:</h4>
        <p>Jan 2025 - Feb 2025</p>
        <h4>Approach:</h4>
        <p>I started by researching flyers that provide services like tutoring. I also looked for inpiration from past DVC flyers. Since there was a lot of information to add, I chose to keep the layout simple and focus on the text.</p>
        <h4>Process:</h4>
        <p>Since this flyer was made for Diablo Valley College, I referenced Olga Serzhantova's DVC Online Education Style Guide. All colors and fonts for the body text are part of the approved color variations.</p>
        <p>I was given the freedom to choose whatever theme I wanted for this project, so I loosely based the design on 90s websites. For this reason, I chose the pixelated font, Born2bSporty FS, for the display text and headings.</p>
