      <h2>Name: EnJOY the Journey</h2>
      <h3>Brief:</h3>
      <p>This project tasks us with creating a promotional poster that accurately conveys a message to its audience. The main requirement is to utilize the various Adobe Illustrator techniques taught during the class.</p>
      <h4>Role: Graphic Designer</h4>
      <h4>Date: Nov 2023 - Dec 2023 </h4>
      <h4>Approach:</h4>
      <p>For this project, I started by brainstorming quotes and messages to base my design around. I ended up choosing “Enjoy the Journey” as my quote. It is meant to reassure the viewer that it is okay to enjoy life no matter how old they get. It takes various aspects of life that can be seen as indulgent or childish and overwhelms the viewer's senses with a colorfully whimsical scene.</p>
      <h4>Process:</h4>
      <p>A better visualization of what I wanted in my poster. Taking care of your inner child, even as you grow up, is very important to me.</p>

      <p>The design for the website was simple enough. I wanted it to emulate the style of old pc games like solitaire or Hoyle Card Games.</p>
